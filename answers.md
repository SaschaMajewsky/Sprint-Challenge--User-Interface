Q:
If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

A:
In HTML you have the freedom to use tags to nest content within like you want to.
Still there are tags already available to you, some of them are more functionality oriented like a <div>.
But some of them provide humans as well as search engines and software for disabled persons a fundamental meaning.
An example for that would be to use a <section> tag instead of a <div> tag. By that you signal that every element within
this <section> is part of a section on the webpage, like a section in a newspaper. Another example would be <footer>
this signals that the contained elements will be one of the last parts of the website.
Writing semantic HTML is important for the reasons mentioned above and good practise as a web developer.

Q:
Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;

A:
display: block
-Element is displayed as a block (like <p> paragraphs tags and <h2>headers tags do by default)
-Whitespace above and below
-NO HTML Element next to it
-Takes as much space as the parent element allowes
-Can be controlled by height and width properties

display: inline
-Element is displayed inline (like <a> anchor tags, <span> span tags or <img> image tags do by default)
-Let's us nest display inline elements into other elements without disrupting the flow of the content
-Only takes as much space as the content of the inline element
-Can be controlled by verticle-align and text-align

Q:
Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

A:
Git is an amazing tool for developers to help them stay organized by providing version control, collaboration and the 
power of testing things out without losing your functional state of the code. It is an absolute standard tool of every
developer out there and often helps IT-Teams seperating the production code from the delevopment/testing environment.
With git you have the ability to control changes getting applied to your codebase precisely and roll your project
back in "time" in the case something went wrong.
